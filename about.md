In news reports and interviews, men have been disappointingly absent
from the voices of support for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
We believe men should be stepping up to show that they believe Dr. Blasey,
and that men should support women when they come forward to report abuse.

Regardless of whether Dr. Blasey chooses to testify on Monday,
we want to make sure that voices of support come through for her,
especially before the scheduled committee hearing.
