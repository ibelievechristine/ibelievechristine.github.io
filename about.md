We noticed that men have been disappointingly absent
from the voices of support for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
We don't think it's right that the loudest voices of men
are from a small group attacking her,
and we don't think it's right that women should have to stand alone.
So we started this campaign to encourage men who believe Dr. Blasey to speak up.
