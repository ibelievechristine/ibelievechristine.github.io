If you believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, it's time to speak up.

We are encouraging everyone to show that they believe Dr. Blasey.
In particular, men have been disappointingly absent
from the voices of support so far;
if you're a man, we're asking you to step up now.
We believe men should support women when they come forward to report abuse.

Regardless of whether Dr. Blasey chooses to testify on Monday,
we want to make sure that voices of support come through for her,
especially before the scheduled committee hearing.
