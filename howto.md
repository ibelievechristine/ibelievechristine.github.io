Want to add your voice of support? Here's how to make an #IBelieveDrFord video.

* Start by saying, "I believe Dr. Ford."  Hold up #IBelieveDrFord on a piece of paper.
* Say something about why it's important to you to listen to women who report abuse.  Speak from the heart, but don't make it about yourself.  Keep it short (30 seconds max). For example, you might just say, "When a victim of abuse chooses to share her story, we should support her."
* Close with, "If you're watching this video, I challenge you to make your own and share it with your friends, especially if you're a man."
* Post your video on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram on Friday between 3 and 5 pm.  Tag it #IBelieveDrFord.
* Tag two or three friends in your post. For example, you might write, "If you believe Dr. Ford, it's time to speak up.  @friend1 @friend2, your turn."
