Want to add your voice of support? Here's how to make an #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord video.

* Hold up #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord on a piece of paper.

* Start by saying clearly: **"I believe Christine Blasey Ford."**

* Declare your support for women who report abuse,
  in a way that has integrity for you.
  Speak from the heart, but don't make it about yourself.
  Here are some examples of things you could say:
    * **"We should be listening to women who come forward to report abuse."**
    * **"It takes tremendous courage to come forward, as she did."**
    * **"Her account is credible, and it deserves a full and fair investigation."**
    * **"When a survivor of abuse chooses to share her story, she deserves our support."**

* End your video with: **"If you're watching this video,
  I challenge you to make your own and
  share it with your friends -- especially if you're a man."**

* Use the tag **#IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord**
  and tag three friends (or public figures) you think should participate,
  by pasting this text into your post:

```
    #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord.
    If you believe her too, it's time to speak up.
    It's your turn: @friend1 @friend2 @friend3
```
