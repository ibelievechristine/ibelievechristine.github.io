Want to add your voice of support? Here's how to make an #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord video.

* Start by saying clearly: "I believe Christine Blasey Ford."  Hold up #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord on a piece of paper.
* Say why it's important to you to listen to women who report abuse.  Speak from the heart, but don't make it about yourself.  Keep it short.  For example, it could be as simple as: "When a victim of abuse chooses to share her story, she deserves our support."
* Close with: "If you believe her too, I challenge you to make your own video and share it with your friends -- especially if you're a man."
* Post your video on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram on Friday between 4 and 7 pm.  Tag it #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord and ask three friends to participate by pasting this text into your post:

    #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord.  If you believe her too, it's time to speak up.  Your turn: @friend1 @friend2 @friend3
